      <h1 className = "title">Our Statements of Faith</h1>
        <p className="paddingLeftRight">
        <b>We Believe:</b> <br></br>
          1.) The Bible to be the infallible and inerrant Word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit , and our supreme and final authority in faith, life and practice!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          2.) There is one true God, eternally existing in three persons-Father, Son and Holy Spirit-each possessing equally all the attributes and character of the Deity!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          3.) Jesus Christ id God, the Living Word, who became flesh through the miraculous coneption by the holy Spirit and His virgin birth. That He is both perfect Deity and true humanity, united in one person forever. In His sinless life, in His miracles, in His all-sufficient and atoning death though His shed blood on the Cross, in His bodily resurrection from the dead, in His visible ascension to the right hand of the Father, and his visible and personal return in power and glory!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          4.) That man was originally created in the image of God. That he sinned by disobeying God thus alienating himself from his Creator. That man's nature is corrupted, seperating him from God and that every man in need of spiratural regeneration by the Holy Spirit!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          5.) The salvation of man is wholly the work of God's free grace and is not in any way the work of human works or goodness or religious ceremon. That God imputes His righteousness and forgiveness of sin to those who put their faith and trust totally in Christ alone for their salvation, and thereby are justified in His sight!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          6.) The Holy spirit came into the world to reveal and glorify Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to men. That He convicts and draws all sinners to Christ, imparts new life to them, continually indwells them and seals them until the day of redemption!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          7.) Every believer is called to live so in the power of the in dwelling Spirit that they will not fulfill the lust, but will bear fruit to the glory of God!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          8.) That Jesus Christ is the Head of Church, His Body, which is composed of all men, living and dead, who have been joined to Him though saving faith!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          9.) That at the physical death, the believer enters immediately into an eternal conscious fellowship with the Lord and awaits the resurrection of the body in glory to live forever with God in a literal heavan!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          10.) That, at the physical death, the unbeliever enters immediately into an eternal conscious seperation from the Lord and awaits the resurrection of their bodies to lie forever in condemation and judgement in a lteral hell
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          11.) In the spiritual unity of believers in the unconditional love of our Lord Jesus Christ!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          12.) That from the beginning Scriptures declare that God created us male and female. Futhermore, the biblical record shows that sexual union was established exclusively within the context of a male-femal relationship(Gen. 2:24), and was formalized in the institution was formalized in the institution of marriage.Therefore since we believe the Bible to be inspired Word of God and the biblical definition of marriage as that between one man and one woman, and that we accept only this definition of this holy institution as ordained by God.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          13.) In the sanctity of human life and that all human life has value. That it us a creative act of God and begins at conception. That the moral issue if abortion is more than a question of the freedom of a woman to control the reproductive functions of her body. It is rather a question of those circumstances under which a human being may be permitted to take the life of another. We therefore oppose abortion for personal and sociolofical purposes. We recognize therapeutic abortions may be necessary where the pregnacy endangers the life of the mother, as in tubal pregnancies.
